export const content = `<p>Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that teaches us to live in harmony with nature, embrace our inner strength, and cultivate virtue. In this article, we explore the insights of Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus—three of the most influential Stoic philosophers—whose teachings help guide us toward a life of resilience, self-mastery, and lasting inner peace.</p>
<h2>Marcus Aurelius (121–180 AD)</h2>
<p>Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher, emphasized self-discipline, rational thought, and acceptance of nature's course. In <a href="https://vreeman.com/meditations/" target="_blank"><em>Meditations</em></a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
  "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."
</blockquote>
<p>This highlights the Stoic principle that inner peace comes from controlling our perceptions and reactions, rather than external circumstances.</p>
<p>He also believed in the interconnectedness of all beings and the importance of living with integrity:</p>
<blockquote>
  "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."
</blockquote>
<p>For Marcus, Stoicism was about aligning actions with virtue, rather than seeking external validation.</p>
<h2>Seneca (4 BC–65 AD)</h2>
<p>Seneca's writings, especially in <a href="https://vreeman.com/seneca/" target="_blank"><em>Letters to Lucilius</em></a> and <a href="https://vreeman.com/seneca/on-the-shortness-of-life" target="_blank"><em>On the Shortness of Life</em></a>, focus on practical philosophy. He argued that time is our most valuable resource:</p>
<blockquote>
  "It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it."
</blockquote>
<p>He saw Stoicism as a way to live wisely by prioritizing what truly matters—virtue over wealth, status, or fleeting pleasures.</p>
<p>Seneca also believed that adversity strengthens character:</p>
<blockquote>
  "Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body."
</blockquote>
<p>From his perspective, suffering is not an evil but an opportunity to cultivate resilience and wisdom.</p>
<h2>Epictetus (c. 55–135 AD)</h2>
<p>A former slave turned Stoic teacher, Epictetus focused on distinguishing what is within our control and what is not. <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/" target="_blank">He famously stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  "Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle: Some things are within our control, and some things are not."
</blockquote>
<p>This is the foundation of Stoic thought—directing effort only toward what we can change, while accepting what we cannot.</p>
<p>He also taught that philosophy is not just about theory but about living virtuously:</p>
<blockquote>
  "Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it."
</blockquote>
<p>For Epictetus, Stoicism is a daily practice that shapes our behavior, not just an intellectual exercise.</p>
<p>In summary, Stoicism teaches that the purpose of philosophy is to live a good life through <strong>virtue</strong>, <strong>self-mastery</strong>, and <strong>acceptance of nature</strong>. The ultimate goal is <em>eudaimonia</em>—a fulfilled and tranquil life achieved by cultivating wisdom and moral integrity.</p>`;
