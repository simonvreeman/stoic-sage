          "question": "What are the 7 rules of Stoicism?",
          "answer_excerpt": "While there isn't one definitive list, the core of Stoic rules centers on mastering your mind, focusing on what you control (your response), accepting what you can't, practicing virtue, living in the present, preparing for adversity, and understanding your own mortality to live a meaningful life. Key rules often cited include Control your mind, not external events; Accept fate; Practice virtue; Memento Mori (remember death); Amor Fati (love your fate); Focus on what you control; and Prepare for hardship.\nHere are common themes presented as rules:\n1. Control Your Mind, Not Outside Events: You can't control what happens, only your reaction to it. Focus your energy on your judgments and actions.\n2. Practice Virtue: Act with wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance. Virtue is the sole good.\n3. Accept What You Can't Control (Amor Fati): Embrace fate and love everything that happens, good or bad, as part of the natural order.\n4. Prepare for Hardship (Premeditatio Malorum): Regularly contemplate worst-case scenarios to build resilience and appreciate the present.\n5. Memento Mori (Remember You Are Mortal): Acknowledge your mortality to live more fully and make the most of each day.\n6. Simplify and Focus: Remove what isn't necessary; focus energy on what truly matters and what is within your control.\n7. Live in the Present: Don't dwell on the past or fear the future; be present and act with intention now.\nOther common Stoic advice includes taking bold action, being disciplined, asking if something is necessary, learning from everyone, and treating challenges as opportunities for growth.\n• 7 Ancient Stoic Tenets To Keep In Mind Today And Every DayMarcus would say that the Stoic finds a way to turn every negative into a positive.

These virtues are interconnected, forming the foundation for navigating life's challenges and achieving moral excellence.\nHere's a breakdown of each:\n• Wisdom: Using reason to understand what is truly good, bad, and indifferent, and applying knowledge for sound judgment.\n• Justice: Acting fairly, with kindness and integrity, always in service of the common good and treating others with inherent dignity.\n• Courage (Fortitude): Facing challenges, fear, and adversity with bravery, resilience, and a steady resolve.\n• Temperance (Self-Control): Practicing moderation, discipline, and restraint over desires, emotions, and actions, avoiding excess.\nMarcus Aurelius famously wrote in his Meditations, \"If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, prudence, self-control, courage...if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservations—it must be an extraordinary thing indeed\".\n• The Four Virtues as stated by Marcus AureliusNov 21, 2019RReddit · r/Stoicism\n• The Highest Good: An Introduction To The 4 Stoic VirtuesDaily Stoic\n• Stoic Virtues to Live By | The Four Virtues of StoicismFeb 13, 2021 — for anyone who's remotely interested in knowing more about stoicism. this age-old school of philosophy essentially boi...YouTube · Vihan Chelliah\n• Stoicism 101: The Four Pillars of Virtue - FacebookJul 1, 2022 — The 4 Virtues of Stoicism Courage.
